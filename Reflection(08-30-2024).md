Reflection (August 30, 2024)

This week I refreshed my memory about doing fetch request. I used fetch request to manipulate data.
I learned more about redis specifically, I learned how to Get, Set, Del, and Expire data using javascript instead of the Exec in Docker.
I created multiple routes in my app.js to edit, add, and delete data.
I learned how and what to put in my compose.yaml and Dockerfile to build the container succesfully.

We had an Tech-Comp class and learned about how to put semicolon and colon properly in a sentence. I also learned how to write in professional and plain language. We we're rewriting sentences that have some problems into a professional and plain language.

We went to Goodland tech building where we we're introduced how they get things done using Azure Devops. Kenli and Michael showed us some funtionalities in Azure.
We installled software like node.js but I already have it installed in my Mac; I installed pip and other software that we will be using.
